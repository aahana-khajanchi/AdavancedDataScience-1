# Assignment 2 and 3



## Introduction

The assignment is divided into 8 Parts. Each of the solution is kept in their respective directory. A brief summary of the contents as follows:


### Part 1:

Making a summary of the following research papers

1.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816308970?via%3Dihub
	
2.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032116307420

3.https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360544212002903


### INFO

1.Language used : Python

2.Process Followed : Exploratory Data Analysis

3.Tools used :  Jupyter Notebook and Docker

#### The dataset is from Jan 1st to May 27th, 2016 


### Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis 
Performing Exploratory Data Analysis from the dataset available at https://github.com/LuisM78/Appliances-energy-prediction-data using the following libraries :- 

1. Plotly

2. Matplotlib

3. Seaborn



#### Abstract
 
<h5>We explored the data using the following libraries:-</h5>

1. MissingNo - which gives the missing values in our dataset

2. Pivottablejs - Drag and drop Pivot Tables and Charts to understand the dataset 

3. PandasProfiling - It generates profile report and gives the summary

4. ipythonwidgets.interact - Automatically creating UI interface which gives controls for exploring code and data interactively

5. Logging - To log all the files




<h5>Generated Extra features:-</h5>


1. NSM - Number of Seconds from Midnight

2. WeekDay - Monday to Sunday

3. WeekDayType - WeekDay or Weekend

4. TimeDelta - Represents a duration between two dates or times




<h6>Plotted Graphs of the following:-</h6>

1. Monthly Average Temperature

2. Monthly Average Humidity

3. Monthly Energy Consumption

4. Hourly Energy Consumption

5. The function day_visual() shows the relation between any two parameters of a particular day in a month

6. The function month_visual shows the relation between any two parameters of a particual month

7. The function month_visual shows the relation between any two parameters of a particular month



Analysed the correlation using day_visual() and month_visual()

Detected the outliers using Boxplot

Generated the summary using PandasProfiling





### Exception Handling and Logging
For Handling Exception used try and except
For Logging, used logging.basicConfig, which will log all the records with time
