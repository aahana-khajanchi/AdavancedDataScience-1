| Part | Description |
| :------| :-----------|
| Part 1: Research Paper Review | Review 3 papers and provide a Jupyter Notebook for each paper. |
| Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis | Conduct EDA using Python libraries (plotly, seaborn, matplotlib etc.). Provide a PowerPoint Report with graphs and key insights. |
| Part 3: Feature Engineering | Conduct thorough feature analysis and use pre-processing techniques to make the data usable. |
| Part 4: Prediction Algorithms | Try Linear Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks to build prediction models in using sklearn in Pyhthon. Compute RMS, MAPE, R2 and MAE for Training and Testing Datasets. Recommend a model. |
